# TrackBud
TrackBud is a full-fledged music player for Android (Mobile ,TV, Wear) and is currently under development.

P.S. I am still working of finding a better name ðŸ¤£

Server side logic is complete.
Client side logic ( UI for TV, Wear, Mobile ) is half done. 
## Features
* Local Audio Playback
* Eleagant UI ðŸ¤£

## Architecture
TrackBud follows a client - server architecture as described in the android docs. 
[Building an audio app](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media-apps/audio-app/building-an-audio-app). It is written entirely in Kotlin
### Server Architecture
#### MusicService
[MusicService](https://github.com/tendaimusakanye/TrackBud/blob/master/common/src/main/java/com/tendai/common/MusicService.kt)
which is a subclass of 
[MediaBrowserService](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media-apps/audio-app/building-a-mediabrowser-client.html)
is a very important
class. It allows
[MediaBrowser](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media-apps/audio-app/building-a-mediabrowser-client.html) 
clients and other applications to discover the music service, connect to the media session and control playback. 

Music Service is also responsible for:
* the audio player in this case [MediaPlayer](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/mediaplayer)
* the [media session](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media-apps/working-with-a-media-session) and the objects that communicate with it
* maintaining a [notification](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/notifiers/notifications) which displays audio information and some controls
* loading audio files from local storage

#### Loading audio files
To retrieve audio files the application uses the repository pattern. See [Android Architecture Blueprints v1](https://github.com/android/architecture-samples/tree/todo-mvp-clean)
. Audio files are loaded using a [ContentProvider](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/content-provider-basics).

#### Audio Playback
The [PlaybackManager](https://github.com/tendaimusakanye/TrackBud/blob/master/common/src/main/java/com/tendai/common/playback/PlaybackManager.kt) class manages playing the actual audio files based on 
[media session callbacks](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media-apps/audio-app/mediasession-callbacks). 
It communicates with the [QueueManager](https://github.com/tendaimusakanye/TrackBud/blob/master/common/src/main/java/com/tendai/common/playback/QueueManager.kt) class to 
* retrieve track metadata
* build and maintain a queue 

and delegates playing the audio file to the [LocalPlayback](https://github.com/tendaimusakanye/TrackBud/blob/master/common/src/main/java/com/tendai/common/playback/LocalPlayback.kt) class.
